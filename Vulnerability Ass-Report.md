# 🛡️ Vulnerability Assessment – Open Database Server Risk
## Project Overview
This vulnerability assessment simulates a real-world scenario involving an e-commerce company with a publicly accessible database server. As a cybersecurity analyst, I used the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 framework to assess threats and recommend remediation strategies.

## 🔍 Key Elements
- System Description: Remote-access database used by global employees to retrieve customer data

- Purpose: Identify risks that threaten data confidentiality, integrity, and availability

## Threat Sources & Events:
- External hackers – Unauthorized access

- Insider threats – Data exfiltration

- Competitors – Denial of Service (DoS)

## 📊 Risk Scoring
Each threat was evaluated by likelihood and impact using a qualitative method:

Risk Score = Likelihood x Severity

Highest risk: Unauthorized access by external attackers (9/9)

## 🛠️ Remediation Strategy
- Remove public access to the database

- Implement firewalls and MFA

- Apply the Principle of Least Privilege

- Enable logging and monitoring (AAA framework)
