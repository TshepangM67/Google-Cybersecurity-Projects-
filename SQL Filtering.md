- Isolating data based on department or region

- Excluding known values to focus investigations

## 🖼️ Screenshots
Screenshots of my work, queries, and results are included in the /screenshots folder.

## 📚 Certificate Context
This lab is part of the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, a professional program designed to build job-ready skills in network security, data protection, and threat detection.

## 📌 Key Takeaway
Being able to filter and query data quickly is a powerful skill in cybersecurity. It helps with investigating threats, monitoring access patterns, and supporting decision-making in real time.
